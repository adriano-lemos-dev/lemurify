A simple toy project to spread the Pearls of Wisdom from Adriano Lemos (that would be me, by the way).

## Getting Started

It's a simple React project. Basic npm scripts knownledge apply here.

### Prerequisites

Gotta have ES6+/React support, so you should have the following environment ready:
- Node/npm (latest is better);
- Yarn (not mandatory, but yeah...);
- Webpack;
- Babel.

### Installing

Simply call the proper npm/yarn action

```
npm install
```

or 

```
yarn 
```

This will do the trick!

## Running the tests

Still working on this, but it just be something like
```
npm test
```

Intend to use Jest.

## Deployment

Still working on this, but I'll use TravisCI to automate the build/deploy process
